## <heading 2> Watersort

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this project is to solve a problem as a game, whereby 
the objective of the game is to sort out the puzzle using the different colours. 

This project had the most impact because, I learned problem solving skills, and I learned how 
to code a simple fun game through back-end coding.
